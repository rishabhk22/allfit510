## Project Objectives
To evelop a user-friendly web-app to create personalized workout plans by blending different fitness methods or exercise types such as yoga, weight training, cardio, calisthenics, and stretching. This is to enable users to have a holistic fitness routine to improve different aspects of their health such as strength, mobility, flexibility, endurance to provide balanced overall fitness. 

## Target
Busy professionals with some experince in workout or fitness traning that want to diversify their fitness routine to be more holistic.

## Primary Needs
- Customization based on goals (such as build strength, increase flexibility, etc.)
- Clear day-wise breakdown of exercise or fitness method
- Time-efficient routines

## Key Deliverables
- Interactive web app interface where users can input their details, goals, and requirements for a fitness plan with their focus
- User onboarding flow with goal selection and fitness level input
- Short details about the workout suggested
- Workout plan generator combining various training types

### Good-to-have
- Steps for workout and how to do it (can be visual or text)
- Progress tracking dashboard

## Special Constraints
- Take user consent before suggesting the workout and physical activity
- Clearly communicate with disclaimers and warnings that fitness advice is non-medical and should be followed at the user's own discretion

## Expected Outcome

- A personalized, flexible, and holistic workout solution that gives the correct fitness routine as per user requirements and that users trust and enjoy engaging with
